A terminal DB for a social network, using mongo DB

## Want to make a new myspace, facebook or linkin?

### Know how to complete the frontend to make it look good but just missing the backend database?

### looks like your in luck! This backend uses mongoose models to sync to the MongoDB to be able to:
* create, update and delete users and thoughts
* create and delete reactions to thoughts
* add and remove friends to a user's friends list
